A) The bug seemed to be related to how cards where placed into the deck. 
   Whenever a "tie"occurs, which really is not a tie, just the game hitting 10,000 turns,
   the cards are evenly split between each player. if you observe the individual wins of each turn,
   you will see that each player wins every other turn. This cause the game to never end.
B) To fix this I changed the way in which cards where placed into the deck. Instead of always
   the first players card to go into the deck first, the winning card always go into the deck first.
